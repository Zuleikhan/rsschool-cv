## About me

Hey! My name is Zuleikha and I am a student of RS school. I am taking a front-end development course and plan to work in the field of web development. Now I don't have much programming experience, but I have a great desire to study and achieve my goal.

## Scills

## Code example
### Codewars 7 kyu kata
**Kata descriprion:**

>Oh no!  
>Some really funny web dev gave you a sequence of numbers from his API response as an sequence of strings!  
>You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.  
>Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.  
>ie:["1", "2", "3"] to [1, 2, 3]  
>Note that you can receive floats as well.

**My solution:**

```
function toNumberArray(stringarray) {
  return stringarray.map(parseFloat);
}

toNumberArray(["1", "2", "3"]);
```
